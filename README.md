# UserClaimsMiddleware
Middleware used to easily fetch claims about the User from various providers and deliver them into your ClaimsPrincipal for further usage in an ASP.Net Web application.

The middleware allows you to add arbitrary Claims Providers and a number of options for exception handling, caching, etc. Available as OWIN, and later for ASP.Net Core.
